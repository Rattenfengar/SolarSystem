# SolarSystem
This project ia about an cross-platform application using Xamarin.Forms and a WebAPI with ASP.NET Core 2.2. The idea of this is to create a standar architecture that collect data from some IoT devices using Particle Photon and Argon, the devices measure the data with some sensors and send them to the WebServer. After, the data is requested by a Xamarin Client (W10, Android, iOS) to be displayed on those platforms.
The project (Software, Hardware, Thesis) is being deveolped by Manuel Alejandro Ordoñez Reyes ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuel-alejandro-ordoñez-846353a9)) adn Jhon Anderson Urbano Diaz ([LinkedIn]) if you have any contibution it's more than welcome.

#Xamarin.Forms Application.
The app is being designed in order to run on Windows 10 (UWP), Android and iOS. So far, iOS application cannot be tested due we don't have an iOS or MAC device to tested it.
In addition, we are expecting the new release of Xamarin Forms 4 in order to use the latest version available and use the new features that are coming with.

#Web API
The Web API is going to be deployed in our personal server using Hyper-V and ISS.
